YAPW is a very simple webserver written in python. Until now, it only can host plain HTML files.
Support for javascript is planed!

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------
YAPW is for educational use only! Don't use YAPW on productive systems!

	
I. System requirements:
-----------------------

    * Computer with at least 233 MHz and 64 MB RAM is recommended
    * 50 MB of hard disk space
    * On Unix machines you have to install python, if not already installed. You can download
	  python at: http://www.python.org/download/
	  
	  The Windows port of the program is powered by Portable Python (http://www.portablepython.com/)
	  and so no installed version of python is needed.
